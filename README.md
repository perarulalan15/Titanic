# Titanic Dataset Machine Learning Project
This repository contains a machine learning project based on the famous Titanic dataset. The dataset is named after the ill-fated RMS Titanic, a British passenger liner that sank in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in a significant loss of lives.

# About the Dataset
The Titanic dataset provides valuable information about the passengers onboard, including attributes such as age, gender, class of travel, ticket fare, cabin, and survival status. It serves as a benchmark for binary classification problems in machine learning, where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or perished based on the available features.

# Project Overview
In this project, I applied various machine learning techniques to analyze the Titanic dataset and build a predictive model. By training the model on a subset of the dataset with known survival outcomes, I aimed to discover patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable. The trained model was then used to make predictions on a separate subset of the dataset, assessing its accuracy and generalization capabilities.

# Key Features
* Exploratory data analysis and visualization to gain insights into the dataset
* Data preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms
* Implementation and evaluation of different machine learning models for survival prediction
* Model performance assessment using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* Documentation of the project methodology and results in Jupyter Notebooks
